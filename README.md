# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances
Bootcamp Challenge 4 demonstrating Javascript variables, comparators, arrays, pseudocode and loops to develop logical data querying

## Description

- This project tests my ability to work with arrays within arrays.
- I was provided with an array of arrays showing a company's monthly profit and loss account for 7 years
- I built by pushing my logical reasoning and using debugging tools.
- This project helped me learn about researching Javascript methods to format variables for output.
- I learned to collaborate and work with others to try different routes and methods to see what works and debug faster.

### User Story

```
AS A business
I WANT the monthly profit and loss data to be summarised
SO THAT I can get an overviez of company performance from the last 7 years.
```

### Acceptance Criteria

* The code is stored in a GitHub repo called `Console-Finances`.

* The programme shows the following outputs to the console:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset.

  * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  * The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The final code should print the analysis to the console matching the following image:![Layout of finished page](./Assets/Images/Screenshot%202022-12-16%20181640.png)

## Installation

This is a basic static front-end website deployment which can be deployed on any server or client with a browser. The console can be opened via the browser developer tool (`F12` or `CTRL` + `Shift` + `i` ) [The GIThub page deployment](https://essexgit.github.io/Console-Finances/)
